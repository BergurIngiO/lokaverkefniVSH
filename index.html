    <h1 class="txtNr1H1">The Jedi Order</h1>
    <p class="txtNr1">The Jedi Order, later known as the Old Jedi Order and referred to as the Holy Order of the Jedi Knights, was an ancient monastic peacekeeping organization unified by its belief and observance of the Force, specifically the light side. The Jedi were the guardians of peace and justice in the Galactic Republic, and became perhaps the most well known of the various groups that relied on the Force for their power. Led by a series of Jedi Councils, the Order grew over the millennia despite facing many trials. Most often these threats were engineered by the Sith, the most prominent group of Force sensitives who wielded the dark side of the Force.</p>

    <h1 class="txtNr2H1">The jedies weapon of choice</h1>
    <p class="txtNr2">The lightsaber, sometimes referred to as a laser sword, was a weapon used by the Jedi and other Force-sensitives. Lightsabers consisted of a plasma blade, powered by a kyber crystal, that was emitted from a usually metal hilt. It was a weapon that required skill and training, and was greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with the Force. Though also used by the Sith, the lightsaber was synonymous with the Jedi, with some in the galaxy believing only Jedi used lightsabers.</p>
    <p class="txtNr2">Lightsabers were generally used for both offense and defense. A lightsaber could cut through virtually anything, from enemies to blast doors. The only ways to block the incoming attack of a lightsaber was with a weapon made with material that conducts energy, such as an electrostaff, Z6 riot control baton, or simply another lightsaber. When used defensively, a Force-sensitive could deflect blaster bolts with a lightsaber, and with skill, could even reflect the shots back toward the shooter or some other target. Experienced Jedi could even employ their lightsabers to absorb Force lightning. Most practitioners used one single-bladed lightsaber, though some used double-bladed lightsabers or even multiple lightsabers at once.</p>

    <h1 class="txtNr2H1">The Temple</h1>
    <p class="txtNr2">The Temple is currently stationed in Hafnarfjörður Iceland on the planet Earth and just now we the jedi order are opening up our doors for force sensitive kids to start there training as a Jedi. We will start training the younglings this summer in June. Only the force sensitive and only them will be able to find the temple anyone else who tries cannot find it.</p>
